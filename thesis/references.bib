   abstract = {In this paper, we implement the non-conforming finite elements for the simulation of two dimensional incompressible Newtonian fluid flows. The classical driven cavity benchmark problem is simulated on a very fine uniform grid. In order to discretize the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) we employ the rotated bilinearQ˜1element for velocity and piecewise constant Q0element for the pressure on the general quadrilateral meshes. In L2-norm this pair is 2ndorder accurate for velocity and provides 1st order accuracy for pressure approximations. For the solution of non-linear systems arising from the discretization, Newton's method is used as an outer nonlinear iteration and for the inner linear sub problems, the direct solver UMFPACK is utilized. The results have been compared with the reference data present in the literature and a good agreement is found.},

@article{nonconf1,
   abstract = {We propose a general algorithm for nonconforming adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) of unstructured meshes in high-order finite element codes. Our focus is on h-refinement with a fixed polynomial order. The algorithm handles triangular, quadrilateral, hexahedral, and prismatic meshes of arbitrarily high-order curvature, for any order finite element space in the de Rham sequence. We present a flexible data structure for meshes with hanging nodes and a general procedure to construct the conforming interpolation operator, both in serial and in parallel. The algorithm and data structure allow anisotropic refinement of tensor product elements in two and three dimensions and support unlimited refinement ratios of adjacent elements. We report numerical experiments verifying the correctness of the algorithms and perform a parallel scaling study to show that we can adapt meshes containing billions of elements and run efficiently on 393,000 parallel tasks. Finally, we illustrate the integration of dynamic AMR into a high-order Lagrangian hydrodynamics solver.},

abstract = {In standard equispaced finite difference (FD) formulas, symmetries can make the order of accuracy relatively high compared to the number of nodes in the FD stencil. With scattered nodes, such symmetries are no longer available. The generalization of compact FD formulas that we propose for scattered nodes and radial basis functions (RBFs) achieves the goal of still keeping the number of stencil nodes small without a similar reduction in accuracy. We analyze the accuracy of these new compact RBF-FD formulas by applying them to some model problems, and study the effects of the shape parameter that arises in, for example, the multiquadric radial function.}

@article{quadtree2,
   abstract = {In this paper, a computational method for solving fluid flow problems with moving interfaces is presented. Herein, adaptive quadtree grids are used coupled with the CICSAM [O. Ubbink, Numerical prediction of two fluid systems with sharp interfaces, PhD Thesis, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London, 1997] free surface capturing volume of fluid (VoF) method and PLIC reconstruction to interpolate the volume fraction field during refinement and derefinement processes. The combination of high resolution adaptive hierarchical remeshing and CICSAM interface advection is shown to overcome the problems of interface smearing and high CPU intensivity inherent in most VoF schemes. The result is a combination of free surface tracking and free surface capturing in that the interface is effectively tracked by the adapting refinements in the quadtree grid. In this way, a sharp interface is achieved and the advantages of both free surface tracking and capturing are combined. The new method is applied to interface advection examples in translating, rotating and shearing flow fields, and the benefits of using adapting quadtree grids demonstrated. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

@report{quadtree1,
   abstract = {ÐQuadtree-based adaptive Cartesian/Quad (quadrilateral) grid generator, grid adaptor and ¯ow solver have been developed and fully demonstrated in this study. Given the de®nition of geome-tries (cubic B-splines and straight line segments), geometrically-adaptive, body-®tted Quad grids are generated automatically. These grids are then overlapped with a large Cartesian cell which is subdivided recursively until the Cartesian cells which are intersected by the outer boundaries of the Quad grids have similar grid resolutions to the Quad cells. The ®nal computational grid is then automatically produced through cell cutting. A Quadtree data structure has been used to store the grids. As a result, grid re®nement and coarsening are trivial to accomplish. A cell-centered, second-order accurate viscous ¯ow solver has been developed. The ¯ow solver supports arbitrary control volumes. Solution-based grid adaptations are carried out after converged solutions are obtained on a given grid. Grid independent inviscid and viscous solutions have been obtained through automatic grid adaptations. The overall solution procedure integrates grid generation, grid adaptation and ¯ow solver into an automated computing environment to achieve maximum eciency and accuracy with minimum human and computer resources. #},

@article{RBF2,
   abstract = {Immersed boundary methods are efficient tools of growing interest as they allow to use generic CFD codes to deal with complex, moving and deformable geometries, for a reasonable computational cost compared to classical body-conformal or unstructured mesh approaches. In this work, we propose a new immersed boundary method based on a radial basis functions framework for the spreading-interpolation procedure. The radial basis function approach allows for dealing with a cloud of scattered nodes around the immersed boundary, thus enabling the application of the devised algorithm to any underlying mesh system. The proposed method can also keep into account both Dirichlet and Neumann type conditions. To demonstrate the capabilities of our novel approach, the imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions on a 2D cylinder geometry in a Navier-Stokes CFD solver, and the imposition of Neumann boundary conditions on an adiabatic wall in an unsteady heat conduction problem are considered. One of the most significant advantage of the proposed method lies in its simplicity given by the algorithmic possibility of carrying out the interpolation and spreading steps all together, in a single step.},

@article{RBF1,
   abstract = {In this study, we examine numerical solutions of Zakharov–Rubenchik system which is a coupled nonlinear partial differential equation. The numerical method in the current study is based on radial basis function finite difference (RBF-FD) meshless method and an explicit Runge–Kutta method. As a radial basis function we choose polyharmonic spline augmented with polynomials. The essential motivation for choosing polyharmonic spline is that it is free of shape parameter which has a crucial role in accuracy and stability of meshless methods. The main benefit of the proposed method is the approximation of the differential operators is performed on local-support domain which produces sparse differentiation matrices. This reduces computational cost remarkably. To see performance of the proposed method, some test problems are solved. L∞ error norms and conserved quantities such as mass and energy are calculated. Numerical outcomes are presented and compared with other methods available in the literature. From the comparison it can be deduced that the proposed method gives reliable and precise results with low computational cost. Stability of the proposed method is also discussed.},

@article{Nakanishi2020,
   abstract = {We introduce a novel liquid simulation approach that combines a spatially adaptive pressure projection solver with the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method. The solver relies on a generalized version of the Finite Difference (FD) method to approximate the pressure field and its gradients in tree-based grid discretizations, possibly non-graded. In our approach, FD stencils are computed by using meshfree interpolations provided by a variant of Radial Basis Function (RBF), known as RBF-Finite-Difference (RBF-FD). This meshfree version of the FD produces differentiation weights on scattered nodes with high-order accuracy. Our method adapts a quadtree/octree dynamically in a narrow-band around the liquid interface, providing an adaptive particle sampling for the PIC advection step. Furthermore, RBF affords an accurate scheme for velocity transfer between the grid and particles, keeping the system's stability and avoiding numerical dissipation. We also present a data structure that connects the spatial subdivision of a quadtree/octree with the topology of its corresponding dual-graph. Our data structure makes the setup of stencils straightforward, allowing its updating without the need to rebuild it from scratch at each time-step. We show the effectiveness and accuracy of our solver by simulating incompressible inviscid fluids and comparing results with regular PIC-based solvers available in the literature.},

abstract = {Abstract Incense, candle smoke and cigarette smoke often exhibit smoke flows with a surface-like appearance. Although delving into well-known computational fluid dynamics may provide a solution to create such an appearance, we propose a much efficient alternative that combines a low-resolution fluid simulation with explicit geometry provided by NURBS surfaces. Among a wide spectrum of fluid simulation, our algorithm specifically tailors to reproduce the semi-transparent surface look and motion of the smoke. The main idea is that we follow the traces called streaklines created by the advected particles from a simulation and reconstruct NURBS surfaces passing through them. Then, we render the surfaces by applying an opacity map to each surface, where the opacity map is created by utilizing the smoke density and the characteristics of the surface contour. Augmenting the results from low-resolution simulations such a way requires a low computational cost and memory usage by design.},

Our tools can greatly enhance games by providing realistic fluid-like effects such as swirling smoke past a moving character. The potential applications are endless. Our algorithms are based on the physical equations of fluid flow, namely the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations are notoriously hard to solve when strict physical accuracy is of prime importance. Our solvers on the other hand are geared towards visual quality. Our emphasis is on stability and speed, which means that our simulations can be advanced with arbitrary time steps. We also demonstrate that our solvers are easy to code by providing a complete C code implementation in this paper. Our algorithms run in real-time for reasonable grid sizes in both two and three dimensions on standard PC hardware, as demonstrated during the presentation of this paper at the conference.},

@article{Stam1999,
   abstract = {Building animation tools for fluid-like motions is an important and challenging problem with many applications in computer graphics. The use of physics-based models for fluid flow can greatly assist in creating such tools. Physical models, unlike key frame or procedural based techniques, permit an animator to almost effortlessly create interesting, swirling fluid-like behaviors. Also, the interaction of flows with objects and virtual forces is handled elegantly. Until recently, it was believed that physical fluid models were too expensive to allow real-time interaction. This was largely due to the fact that previous models used unstable schemes to solve the physical equations governing a fluid. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an unconditionally stable model which still produces complex fluid-like flows. As well, our method is very easy to implement. The stability of our model allows us to take larger time steps and therefore achieve faster simulations. We have used our model in conjuction with advecting solid textures to create many fluid-like animations interactively in two- and three-dimensions. Copyright ACM 1999.},

abstract = {Polynomials are used together with polyharmonic spline (PHS) radial basis functions (RBFs) to create local RBF-finite-difference (RBF-FD) weights on different node layouts for spatial discretizations that can be viewed as enhancements of the classical finite differences (FD). The presented method replicates the convergence properties of FD but for arbitrary node layouts. It is tested on the 2D compressible Navier–Stokes equations at low Mach number, relevant to atmospheric flows. Test cases are taken from the numerical weather prediction community and solved on bounded domains. Thus, attention is given on how to handle boundaries with the RBF-FD method, as well as a novel implementation for hyperviscosity. Comparisons are done on Cartesian, hexagonal, and quasi-uniform node layouts. Consideration and guidelines are given on PHS order, polynomial degree and stencil size. The main advantages of the present method are: 1) capturing the basic physics of the problem surprisingly well, even at very coarse resolutions, 2) high-order accuracy without the need of tuning a shape parameter, and 3) the inclusion of polynomials eliminates stagnation (saturation) errors. A MATLAB code is given to calculate the differentiation weights for this novel approach.}
